# Intro / Concept
Cultural institutions mostly have a lot to say. They address their target-groups through social media and communicate their programs or products. Since social media platforms became places of visual chaos, ads and junk, today businesses have to be visually recognizable and remarkable. 

Unfortunately design- and branding-services are unaffordble for small cultural businesses, so most of them don't even think about hiring a good designer.

What of we could teach an every-day device a companies visual identity and create an app, does the design by itself?

This is a concept that is already in use since a few years.
